***Project Pokemon!!!***
************************

Currently Incomplete

This is going to be a pokemon battle simulator that I am creating in Java SE 8.
Eventually I'd like to turn this into a full blown game based off of the original GBA pokemon games. 

I Started this game based off using the Rock, Paper, Scissors mechanics and not all my comments have been updated yet, but the idea is that I needed a starting point to figure out how to create the battle logic concepts, and from there I can move forward into creating a text based adventure story to help add a story to the game itself.

**************************************************
***As of current this is what I've accomplished***
**************************************************

-Created a simple rock paper scissors CLI
-converted the rock paper scissors CLI to acept and output string values instead of int values
- created a GUI for the rock paper scissors CLI
- converted the rock paper scissors to gui to a pokemon gui
- tried to implement additonal options for selection and having a bad time!!!! need to continue working on it

****************************
***Things I'd like to add***
****************************
- Hp mechanics
- roster switch in/witch out mechanics
- resitances and weaknesses

*********************
***The Big Picture***
*********************

- BUILD A FULLY OPERATIONAL GAME AND RULE THE WORLD!!!!
